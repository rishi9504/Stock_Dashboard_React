# Stock Dashboard App
This project is a stock dashboard app that uses the Finnhub API

* Search for a stock (e.g. AAPL, FB, GOOG)
* Get more details of a stock (name, currency, market cap, etc.)
* View historical chart data of a stock (day/week/month/year)
* Select theme (dark/light)

Trying my hands on tailwind, Charting is JS using rechart, and using Context Api. 
Made this project with inspiration from some sources that will be updated in due time

TODO:
Clear search area once stock is selected.
Update UI for recent IPO details
